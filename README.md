## Motivation

India is developing at a very rapid speed today resulting in great urban expansion. There are more people commuting than ever before and traffic in metros has risen to record levels

Some of the major problems faced by people who commute in their own vehicle are:-

- Unnecessary wastage of fuel, time, and effort while searching for safe parking spaces within a city.
- Lack of commercial parking lots within a city.
- Fear of vehicles being towed away by law enforcement officers.

## Features

- Search parking slots on the app and book online instantly.
- Pay hourly, weekly and monthly rates.
